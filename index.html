    <h1>A Softcover Book Report</h1>
    <h2>Moby-Dick (or, The Whale)</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href=" https://www.softcover.io/">softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks kie some popular IT Textbooks but it's also good for making more traditional books,
            such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as Moby Dick). We present below a short and affectionately irreverent book report on this class of American Literature.
