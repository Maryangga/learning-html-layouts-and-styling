    <h2>Moby-Dick (or, The Whale)</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href=" https://www.softcover.io/" target="_blank">softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks kie some popular IT Textbooks but it's also good for making more traditional books,
            such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as Moby Dick). We present below a short and affectionately irreverent book report on this class of American Literature.

            <a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" target="_blank">Moby-Dick</a> by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
        </p>
        <p> 
        <blockquote> Call me Ishmael. Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little 
        and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.</blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
        After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you, Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approxiamately one jillion pages. The only thing bigger
        than Moby Dick (who-<em>spoiler alert!</em>-is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
